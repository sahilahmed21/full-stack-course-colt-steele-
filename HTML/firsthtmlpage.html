        Colt <b>steele</b> is obbsessed with chickens and he has chicken as his pets in his home
        <p>The chicken (Gallus domesticus) is a domesticated species that arose from the red junglefowl, originally from
            Southeast Asia. They have also partially hybridized with other wild species of junglefowl (the grey
            junglefowl,
            Ceylon junglefowl, and green junglefowl).[1] Rooster and cock are terms for adult male birds, and a younger
            male
            may be called a cockerel. A male that has been castrated is a capon. An adult female bird is called a hen,
            and a
            sexually immature female is called a pullet. Humans keep chickens primarily as a source of food (consuming
            both
            their meat and eggs) or as pets. Traditionally, they were also bred for cockfighting, which is still
            practiced
            in some places. Chickens domesticated for meat are broilers, and for eggs, they are layers.

            Chickens are one of the most common and widespread domestic animals, with a total population of 23.7 billion
            as
            of 2018,[2] up from more than 19 billion in 2011. There are more chickens in the world than any other bird.
            There are numerous cultural references to chickensâ€”in myth, folklore, and religion, as well as in language
            and
            literature.

            Genetic studies have pointed to multiple maternal origin theories within South Asia, Southeast Asia, and
            East
            Asia,[3] but the clade found in the Americas, Europe, the Middle East, and Africa originated from the Indian
            subcontinent. From ancient India, the chicken spread to the Eastern Mediterranean. They appear in ancient
            Egypt
            in the mid-15th century BC, with the "bird that gives birth every day" having come from the land between
            Syria
            and Shinar, Babylonia, according to the annals of Thutmose III.<sub>[4][5][6]</sub>/sub They are known in
            ancient Greece from
            the 5th century BC.<sup>[7][8] </sup>
